Gender Detection Using HTML, CSS, and Python
Overview
This project demonstrates a Gender Detection system using the UTKFace dataset. The application uses Python for backend processing and HTML/CSS for the frontend interface. The goal is to classify gender from facial images with accuracy and efficiency.

Features
Frontend: A responsive user interface for uploading images.
Backend: Python-based model for gender classification.
Dataset: UTKFace dataset for training and testing the model.
User Interaction: Simple and intuitive file upload mechanism for gender detection.
Technologies Used
Frontend:
HTML: Structure of the web application.
CSS: Styling for a user-friendly and responsive interface.
Backend:
Python: Core programming for processing and model inference.
Machine Learning Libraries: TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Pandas.
Dataset:
UTKFace Dataset: Contains images with labeled genders and ages.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or above.
Virtual Environment (optional but recommended).
Required Python Libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas flask  
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
